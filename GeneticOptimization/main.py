Writing an optimizer for the positioning of a node on a cartesian plane that has minimal summed distance to a set of
randomly generated points

Optimization done using genetic programming

Paradigm:
The interest node will be given a chromosome, an underlying data that when manifested, is what defines the entire node's
structure. To find the chromosome that fits the optimal location, we spawn generations of chromosomes.
